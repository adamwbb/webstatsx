WEBStatsX Reloaded is a continuation of the work from cynexit's project. All help and support is needed so please feel free to contribute to this project to have it up and running sooner.


This is an alternative Web-Interface for the Stats plugin by lolmewn. ( http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/lolmewnstats/ )
It displays nearly everything you can get out of the collected data, it is also working on small screens (mobile phones, tablets).

=== What do I need? ===
You need to have the Stats plugin up and running,
additionally you'll need to have a web server (any will do, apache, nginx etc.) and PHP (at least 5.3, not tested with 5.2).

=== Where do I get it? ===

   * Direct Download from github (master.zip)

=== How do I install it? ===

   1. Extract all files of the archive to your desired folder in the web server directory.
   2. Open the config_demo.php file, enter your server values.
   3. Rename config_demo.php to config.php
   4. Done
