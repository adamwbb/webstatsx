Get other stats working.


This is an alternative Web-Interface for the Stats plugin by lolmewn. ( http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/lolmewnstats/ )
It displays nearly everything you can get out of the collected data, it is also working on small screens (mobile phones, tablets).

=== What do I need? ===
You need to have the Stats plugin up and running,
additionally you'll need to have a web server (any will do, apache, nginx etc.) and PHP (at least 5.3, not tested with 5.2).

=== Where do I get it? ===

   * Direct Download from github (master.zip)

=== How do I install it? ===

   1. Extract all files of the archive to your desired folder in the web server directory.
   2. Open the config_demo.php file, enter your server values.
   3. Rename config_demo.php to config.php
   4. Done
